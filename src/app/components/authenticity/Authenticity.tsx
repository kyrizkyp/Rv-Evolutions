            We understand how important the authenticity and exclusivity of each
            of our products is. Therefore, each of our clothing items comes with
            a unique serial number ensuring that you are getting a genuine
            product from RV. This serial number is not just identification, but
            also a guarantee that you are getting the quality and design that we
            have carefully designed.
